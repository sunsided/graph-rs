# Graphs Playground in Rust

A work in progress to experiment with graph representation and memory layout.

See [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs) for the main `Graph` representation and [src/path_queries](src/path_queries) for simple
BFS, DFS and A* search and traversal implementations.

## Example Graphs

- Neo4j's [Movies Graph Example](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/movies).
- A "Scotland Yard"-type map of London.
